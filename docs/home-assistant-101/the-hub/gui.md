# GUI: CONFIGURATION

- [Automatic](#automatic)
- [Manual](#manual)

The Home Assistant user interface is known as Lovelace - its fast, easy, and easily customizable.  The Lovelace UI is comprised of cards - you choose the type (ex. a Thermostat card), the items to display, theme, layout, and more.  You can even add community cards through HACS.

## Automatic
By default, Home Assistant automatically creates and modifies the UI as you add and remove devices.

## Manual
While automatic Lovelace creation is convienent, it is also limited (you can't customize anything - cards to show, card titles, themes, etc).  By manually creating the Lovelace user interface, you can also change control and backup the user interface code to Github.

Follow [these instructions](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/yaml-mode/) to manually design the user interface.
