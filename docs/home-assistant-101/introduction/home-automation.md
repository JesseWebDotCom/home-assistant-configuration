Home Automation controls and automates every aspect of your home.  It can perform simple actions (ex. turn on light) or complex, intelligent routines.  It can also extend to devices and data beyond your home (ex. your cars and phone, weather advisories, etc).

## Benefits and Possibilities
With a platform as extensible as [Home Assistant](http://home-assistant.io), the home
